## Intro
The EcoLens web application is designed to harness the power of Generative AI to revolutionize waste management. 
The app integrates AI image recognition to identify whether waste is recyclable or non-recyclable, providing real-time 
feedback and promoting sustainable waste practices. With a growing global concern about plastic waste and the environmental 
harm it causes, EcoLens offers an innovative approach to smart recycling by educating users and empowering them to make 
responsible waste management decisions.

## About
EcoLens uses Google's Gemini AI to analyze uploaded images, classify them, and offer insights on recyclability, environmental impacts, 
and suggestions for proper waste management. By leveraging AI‚Äôs image recognition capabilities, the app provides users with immediate 
feedback on the type of waste in the image and how it should be processed. This approach aims to increase recycling rates, reduce 
environmental pollution, and contribute to a circular economy model where waste and economic growth can be decoupled.

The application includes a simple interface where users can upload images of waste items, and based on the AI analysis, they receive 
detailed feedback. This feedback not only classifies waste but also suggests sustainable waste disposal methods, providing educational 
value and practical tips.


## Challenges
* Waste Mismanagement: Improper disposal and classification of waste remain a global problem,
  contributing to pollution, environmental degradation, and health hazards.

* User Adoption of AI: While the application offers cutting-edge AI technology, encouraging users
  to adopt these new tools for waste management may be a challenge, particularly in communities unfamiliar
  with digital solutions.

* Recycling Contamination: Incorrectly sorting recyclables from non-recyclables leads to contamination, which
  reduces the quality of recycled materials and increases costs.

* Awareness and Education: Many individuals lack the necessary knowledge to understand what materials are recyclable
  or hazardous, leading to improper waste disposal.


## Solutions
* AI-Powered Waste Classification: EcoLens provides a real-time AI-based waste classification system that helps users
  identify recyclable and non-recyclable items, increasing efficiency in sorting waste.

* Promoting User Engagement: The application is user-friendly, with simple image uploading features and immediate feedback,
  encouraging more people to engage with it regularly and make informed decisions about waste disposal.

* Reducing Contamination: By providing clear instructions on waste management and reducing the risk of recycling contamination,
  EcoLens improves the quality of recycled materials, supporting more sustainable recycling efforts.

* Educating on Environmental Impact: The detailed AI analysis educates users about the environmental harm caused by certain waste materials,
  raising awareness and fostering more responsible behavior.
