				**1. AI-Powered Image Recognition for Waste Classification**:
				EcoLens utilizes AI to analyze uploaded images and classify
				them as either recyclable or garbage. This feature leverages
				generative AI capabilities to provide quick and accurate assessments
				of waste items.
				
				**2. Potential for Increased Recycling Rates**:
				By accurately identifying recyclable materials, EcoLens aims to enhance
				recycling rates. Higher-quality recycled materials can drive up overall
				recycling percentages, supporting sustainability goals.
				
				**3. Real-Time Decision Making for Users**:
				The app provides instant feedback on uploaded images, allowing users to
				make informed decisions about what can be recycled versus what should go
				in the trash. This real-time guidance helps reduce contamination and improves
				recycling practices.
				
				**4. Data-Driven Insights for Waste Management**:
				While not explicitly mentioned, EcoLens' image analysis could contribute to
				broader waste management strategies. By analyzing patterns in uploaded images,
				the app could generate insights about common recyclables, contamination rates,
				and other trends in local waste streams.
				
				**5. Contribution to Circular Economy Goals**:
				By empowering individuals to better identify and recycle materials,
				EcoLens supports the transition towards a circular economy. This aligns
				with global efforts to reduce plastic waste and promote sustainable consumption
				practices .

                1. Municipal solid waste generation is predicted to grow from
                2.1 billion tonnes in 2023 to 3.8 billion tonnes by 2050.
                In 2020, the global direct cost of waste management was an
                estimated USD 252 billion. When factoring in the hidden costs
                of pollution, poor health and climate change from poor waste
                disposal practices, the cost rises to USD 361 billion.
                
                2. Without urgent action on waste management, by 2050 this global annual
                cost could almost double to a staggering USD 640.3 billion.
                The reportâ€™s modelling shows that getting waste under control by
                taking waste prevention and management measures could limit net annual
                costs by 2050 to USD 270.2 billion.

                3. However, projections show that a circular economy model, where waste generation
                and economic growth are decoupled by adopting waste avoidance, sustainable business
                practices, and full waste management, could in fact lead to a full net gain of
                USD 108.5 billion per year.
                
                We need to act now in order to avoid the worst scenario. The report provides
                guidance and suggested actions for Multinational development banks, national governments,
                municipalities, producers and retailers, the waste management sector as well as citizens.
